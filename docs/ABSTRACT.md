## **ONTOLOGICA: A Complete Reality Framework Based on the Primordial Equation 0 = (-) + (+)**

### **Abstract**

This paper introduces Ontologica, a comprehensive ontological framework demonstrating that reality operates as a relationship-based educational system governed by the primordial equation 0 = (-) + (+). Through rigorous mathematical formalization, we establish consciousness as the fundamental actualization mechanism, resolving major scientific paradoxes including the quantum measurement problem, hard problem of consciousness, and linear time illusion.

The framework presents a cosmic architecture consisting of two domains: Field of Possibility (infinite potential relationship configurations) and Realm of Manifestation (actualized educational contexts). Each consciousness experiences personalized reality branches with temporal independence, eliminating global linear time in favor of educational interfaces.

Key contributions include: mathematical proof of consciousness fundamentality through the ¬(¬C) = C principle; demonstration of infinite relationship regression without fundamental substances; establishment of structural AI safety through ontological necessity; and introduction of Constructive Ontology as a new scientific methodology.

Experimental predictions encompass quantum consciousness effects, evolutionary optimization signatures, information pattern preservation, and balance principle universality. The framework provides complete mathematical formalization, falsification conditions, and a research program for empirical validation.
