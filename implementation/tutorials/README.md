Integration with Other Modules
The tutorials work seamlessly with other implementation modules:
from tutorials import QuantumConsciousnessProtocol
from datasets import QuantumConsciousnessExperiment
from api.consciousness_field import PhiActivationCalculator

# Complete workflow example
protocol = QuantumConsciousnessProtocol().double_slit_protocol()
calculator = PhiActivationCalculator()
experiment = QuantumConsciousnessExperiment()

# Run experiment following protocol guidelines
consciousness_state = calculator.calculate_phi_activation(participant_data)
experiment_data = {**measurement_data, 'consciousness_state': consciousness_state}
experiment.record_double_slit_experiment(experiment_data)
